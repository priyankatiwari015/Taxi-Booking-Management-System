This Taxi Booking Management System is a Python application that simulates end-to-end taxi trip management. It supports Basic and Enterprise customers, allowing them to book trips with single or multiple destinations, choose extra services or packages, and calculate total costs including distance fees, basic fees, and discounts. The system manages data for customers, locations, rates, and services/packages with object-oriented design, employing inheritance, polymorphism, and custom exceptions for robust input validation.

Key features include:

Adding, updating, and listing customers, locations, rate types, and services/packages

Booking trips with dynamic distance and multi-destination support

Automatic discount calculation based on customer type and distance

Generating detailed receipts and maintaining booking history

Identifying the most valuable customer based on total spending

File-based persistence with error handling for missing or invalid data
